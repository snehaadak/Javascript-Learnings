- **Scope**
    - Scope in Javascripted is directly related to the lexical environment
    - Understanding with below code eg:

        function a(){
            console.log(b);     ---------> [ 10 ]
        }
        var b = 10;
        a();

     for above code b is declared in the global scope ye it will print when called inside of the function a. Because when it is called to console inside of function a JS first searches for the b varible inside its own execution context. if not found inside of that it moves to the outer environment. In our case it moved outside the execution context of a i.e the global execution context. Hence fetched the value. of b
