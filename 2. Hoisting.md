- **Hoisting**
    - It is a phenomenan in javascript that lets you access the variables and functions even before they are defined/initialized.
    - Generic JS code:
        var x = 7;
        function getTitle(){
            console.log("Hello World!);
        }

        getTitle();      ---------------> [Hello World!]
        console.log(x)   ---------------> [ x ]   

    - Code Explaining Hoisting: The below code won't throw error even if we call the fucntion even before it is created nor it will throw error of the var that wasn't initialized yet. The only difference would be the value of x would be undefined as per the concept we learned in execution context. 

        getTitle();      ---------------> [Hello World!]
        console.log(x)   ---------------> [ undefined ]

        var x = 7;
        function getTitle(){
            console.log("Hello World!);
        }
