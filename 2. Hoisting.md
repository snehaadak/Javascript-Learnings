- **Hoisting**
    - It is a phenomenan in javascript that lets you access the variables and functions even before they are defined/initialized.
    - Generic JS code:
        var x = 7;
        function getTitle(){
            console.log("Hello World!);
        }

        getTitle();      ---------------> [Hello World!]
        console.log(x)   ---------------> [ x ]   

    - Code Explaining Hoisting: The below code won't throw error even if we call the fucntion even before it is created nor it will throw error of the var that wasn't initialized yet. The only difference would be the value of x would be undefined as per the concept we learned in execution context. 

        getTitle();      ---------------> [Hello World!]
        console.log(x)   ---------------> [ undefined ]

        var x = 7;
        function getTitle(){
            console.log("Hello World!);
        }

- **Difference between Undefined and Not defined**
    - When a variable is declared in JS it initially allocates a memory to that variable with a placeholder called "*undefined*"before we assign it any value.
    - Whereas JS shows "*not defined*" for variables that are not even declared in anywhere in entire global space.
    - for eg:
        console.log(a);    ---------------> [ undefined ]
        var a = 7;          //assigned value to a
        console.log(a);    ---------------> [ 7 ]
        console.log(x);    ---------------> [ not defined ]

    - Ingeneral when we create a function it executes even when it is called before creation.But incase of an arrow function it will throw a typeError, because an arrow function is stored as a variable and not a function.
