 - Everything in Javascript happens inside an **Execution context**: *assume it to be a big container in which the whole code is executed*

 - It has 2 components: 
    - **Variable Environment** (Memory block)
    - **Thread of Execution** (Code block)

- **How Javascript code is executed?**

     - When below code runs a execution context is created
        var n = 2
        function sqr(num){
            var ans = num * num;
            return ans;
        }
        var square2 = sqr(2);
        var square4 = sqr(4);   //invoking fucntion twice, once for 2 and once for 4 as arguments

    - The Execution context runs in two phases as mentioned above:
        - Memory creation phase 
        - Running of actual code

- **Memory Creation Phase**
    - In this phase memory is allocated to each and every variable and functions.
    - At initial phase before code running starts all the variables are allocated with *undefined*, and in case of functions it stores the whole function.
